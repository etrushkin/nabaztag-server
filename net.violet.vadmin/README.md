# VAdmin

## Description

Backoffice for the `my-nabaztag` interface. Allowed Violet staff to configure services like Weather, etc., and localize the application.

## Database

You'll need a user in the database to be able to log in (Check the `test-data.sql` file under the `platform` project for details) as well as an `admin_permissions.txt` file containing one line per user.

You can't really use it because it heavily relies on the database content...
